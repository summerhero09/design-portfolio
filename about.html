        <div class="intro">
            Hi! I’m Chris Shia, a sophomore at Yale University studying Computing and the Arts, a joint major between Computer Science and visual art. I’m passionate about all things design, specifically with a focus on various aspects of game/interaction design (such as gameplay, narrative, world, graphic design, etc.). As more of a generalist with a variety of skills, I've used my experience to fill many different roles and help lead teams and look at the general creative direction of a project.
            <br>
            <br>
            I always try to blend interaction with storytelling and put a magical twist on the mundane, and I love anything with a touch of the fantastical! I want to create <div class ="gamelabel">wonder</div> through the games I work on, the same way I am so often entranced by media of all kinds. Some of my favorite games, like Unpacking and Coffee Talk, play with how the player interacts with the world and telling unique stories through interaction, gameplay, and systems. Through design, I hope to create experiences that allow the player/user to be immersed in virtual worlds. I also hope to highlight queer stories as much as possible, as a queer gamer myself who found solace in video games.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of game design, I have a variety of passions and hobbies. I love creative writing and drawing on my iPad, and I also play the cello! I speak four languages and am currently working towards a Certificate in Japanese Langauge at Yale. I studied abroad in Osaka, Japan, for two months this past summer! I am also an avid fan of Ghibli movies and magical realism stories!
